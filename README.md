# Hey! 👋

I am **C0d1ngR4bb1t** and I like coding as a hobby.

### Where my alias comes from
My alias comes from _**Matrix**_ because of the famous quote: _"Follow the **White Rabbit**__, changing "white" with "coding". And why not change the vocals with numbers? The final result is **C0d1ngR4bb1t**.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on nothing, but I plan to work on:
  - **HTML** projects
  - **Python3🐍** projects.
  - **MODDING** repositories and stuff
- 📚 I’m currently learning **Python3** and **Ethical Hacking**
- :octocat: My old github Acc. (I erased it less than a year ago) was ModdedStuffGuy, the one who modded General Mathematics. As well, on that account, I created the first javascript bookmarklet that allowed the user to edit his/her LocalStorage on a website by using prompts. I created that script because I observed that there were a great ammount of javascript tools that edited LocalStorage to store data on it (such as Eruda Devtools) and to inspect it, but did not allow the user to edit by himself/herself the LocalStorage. I will re-import that script on my main github page.
